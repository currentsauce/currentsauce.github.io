Hello there! 

Over the years, I have learnt a lot from various sources on the internet. I've always said that i'd like to create a website of my own to blog about the things that I do, as i'd like to try help others out in the same way I have been helped out. So, this is that website!

Why Current Sauce? I love a good pun! It's a play on words between an electrical current source, and fruity currant sauce. Truthfully, this is the best that I could come up with! :rofl:

I launched this website in August 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, what a time to be creative!

**Who am I?**
I'm James. I'm a 29 year old Electronic Design Engineer in Manchester, UK.
I graduated with an M.Eng. in *Electrical and Electronic Engineering* at The University of Manchester in 2014, but I tend to ignore the first 'E' as I did very few *Electrical* modules and have forgotten what I did learn, and I'm at peace with that! I moved to Manchester from Doncaster, South Yorkshire and ended up settling in Manchester where I live with my partner.

Electronics is one of my hobbies, though I also enjoy Snowboarding, Rock Climbing (and bouldering too I guess) and Hiking to name a few. I'm also a massive softy for cats and dogs, though I don't have any right now...yet!

**What about this website?**
I spent far too long trying to decide how to build a website. I'm no web designer[^1], but using a WYSIWYG platform [^2] just seemed like cheating to me, I wanted something that I had to work on!
So I eventually settled on using Jekyll, which super convenient as I can host the site using Github pages. Fabulous! The theme that I am using is called [Bulma Clean Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme) by [C.S. Rhymes](https://www.csrhymes.com). It's great, isn't it! I couldn't have done this and am so grateful that it is available to use!

[^1]: Okay, I'll admit that when I was 14 I learnt HTML 4 and made some okay to shambolic websites. I'm not wanting to go there again.
[^2]: I know i'd get frustrated with it too. I wrote my 3rd year dissertation in *LaTeX* and it was wonderful. Ah, memories.
