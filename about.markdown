Hello there! 

Over the years, I have learnt a lot from various sources on the internet. I've always said that i'd like to create a website of my own to blog about the things that I do, as i'd like to try help others out in the same way I have been helped out. So, this is that website!

Why Current Sauce? I love a good pun! It's a play on words between an electrical current source, and fruity currant sauce. Truthfully, this is the best that I could come up with! :')

I launched this website in August 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, what a time to be creative!

**Who am I?**
I'm James. I'm a 29 year old Electronic Design Engineer in Manchester, UK.
I graduated with an M.Eng. at The University of Manchester in 2014. I moved to Manchester from Doncaster, South Yorkshire and ended up settling in Manchester where I live with my partner.

Electronics is one of my hobbies, though I also enjoy Snowboarding, Rock Climbing (and bouldering too I guess) and Hiking to name a few. I'm also a massive softy for cats and dogs, though I don't have any right now...yet!
