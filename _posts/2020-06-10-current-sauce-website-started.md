I've been promising myself for the last 5 years that I would create a website/blog, and it looks like I may have finally fulfilled that promise! :D
(definitely nothing to do with the "lockdown" of this pesky Covid-19, honest!
I've always been really grateful for all of the online resources out there when I'm doing projects of my own, and have always felt that I should give back to others like me.
So, here we go! Let's try and keep this up and make it something worthwhile! :)
