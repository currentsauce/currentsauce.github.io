I've always loved vinyl records! I remember my first time - I was around 10 years old and found my mums original [ELO - Out Of The Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Blue_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_album)) LP, and thought *wow that's cool!* and played the first track *Turn to Stone*, amazing. Well, I'm not the type of person who insists that it is better than digital music, or that it is "warmer", no, I just think its really cool! I mean, its just pure sound vibrations *(even more cool that you can hear the sound from the stylus too)*[^1] that get turned into an electrcal signal through a pair of magnets and coils, such simple yet fundamental elements.

...anyway, enough effervescing over vinyl records...

[^1]: Lost count of the amount of people that are amazed that you can play a vinyl record with a £5/£10/£20 note :joy:
