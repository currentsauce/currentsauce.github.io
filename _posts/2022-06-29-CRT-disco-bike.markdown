The Canal and River Trust participates in LGBTQ+ Pride Parades all over the country, and they wanted to up their game. They already had an Ice Cream Bike, which they used at various events, and they wanted to be able to  transform it into a Disco Bike for whenever they go to parades. The idea being that the freezer unit is swapped with an enclosure of the same size, which is a self contained, self powered Public Address (PA) system, capable of playing music loudly.
