The Canal and River Trust participates in LGBTQ+ Pride Parades all over the country, and they wanted to up their game. They already had an Ice Cream Bike, which they used at various events, and they wanted to be able to  transform it into a Disco Bike for whenever they go to parades. The idea being that the freezer unit is swapped with an enclosure of the same size, which is a self contained, self powered Public Address (PA) system, capable of playing music loudly.

## Requirements
The goals for this project are:
### Must Haves:
- Have speakers mounted within the enclosure, facing the outside
- Create sound from both left and right of the bike
- Be loud!
- ...And be decent sound quality
- Enclosure has artwork, so not interfere with the overall appearance of that
- Self powered from an internal battery
- ...which can power the unit for 2 hours
- All be self contained within the freezer-sized enclosure

### Nice to Have:
- Incorporate LED lighting for extra "wow"
- Built in battery charging capability
- Easy way of determining the battery level
