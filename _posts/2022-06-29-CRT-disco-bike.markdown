The Canal and River Trust participates in LGBTQ+ Pride Parades all over the country, and they wanted to up their game. They already had an Ice Cream Bike, which they used at various events, and they wanted to be able to  transform it into a Disco Bike for whenever they go to pride parades. The idea being that the freezer unit is swapped with an enclosure of the same size, which is a self contained, self powered Public Address (PA) system, capable of playing music loudly.

## Requirements
The goals for this project are:
### Must Haves:
- Have speakers mounted within the enclosure, facing the outside
- Create sound from both left and right of the bike
- Be loud!
- ...And be decent sound quality
- Enclosure has artwork, so not interfere with the overall appearance of that
- Self powered from an internal battery
- ...which can power the unit for 2 hours
- All be self contained within the freezer-sized enclosure

### Nice to Have:
- Incorporate LED lighting for extra "wow"
- Built in battery charging capability
- Easy way of determining the battery level

## The Plan

The enclosure was made by the manufacturer of the bike, and has some nice Canal & River Trust branding with a snazzy LGBTQ+ flair! Externally, the dimensions are `H: 680mm, W: 540mm, L: 870mm`.

The first thing to considder is how it is powered, as this will dictate a lot of the system. It needs to be operate for at aleast 2 hours, so this will require a hefty battery. I decided to use a deep-cycle leisure battery that is intended for use in motor-homes and caravans, due to it being able to sustain large loads over a prolonged period of time, and the battery chemistry generally being able to handle deep-discharges. In comparison, a standard car battery is not suitable here; they are designed to give a very short burst of current to the starter of a car, and then more or less immediately get recharged by the alternator - not long use, and not deep-discharges. In addition, leisure batteries come in much larger capacities than car batteries, at the expense of a larger size.

I settled on a `NUMAX DC25MF` 105Ah Sealed Leisure Battery.
