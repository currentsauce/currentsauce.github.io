I somehow ended up with this original Bose Sounddock. Its only means of audio input is via a 30-pin iPod dock connector. Notwithstanding that this connector is now obsolete, the 30-pin dock connector had come off. From my trawling of the internet, this is a fairly common problem.

Now, it was fairly lucky that when this connector came off, it didn't rip off the copper footprint on the PCB. So I was able to use my trusty Hakko FX-951 iron and re-solder it back on (thanks, Flux!). I dug out my old trusty *(pink)* iPod nano, and sure enough, the sounddock works again!

But that's boring
