James Has a Website...
---------------------------------------------------
Hi! I’m **James Kincell**, an **Electronics Engineer** based in Manchester (Stockport).  
I specialise in **designing, building, and troubleshooting electronic systems**, and I am now looking to bring those skills into **interactive and immersive installations**.

This site is where I document my projects - electronics design, installs, hacks, tinkerings and repairs. 


My aim is to combine my technical background with a passion for creative, real-world systems. I’ve always loved electronics, lighting installations, and the process of turning an idea into something that works in the real world. Whether it’s building from scratch, adapting existing hardware, or troubleshooting until a solution is found, I enjoy creating systems that are both functional and reliable. Solving problems — and seeing the end result come to life — is what drives me.
